Football Club ERP System

A full-stack Football Club **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)** web application built with **React** (frontend) and **Django** (backend).

This application provides a centralized system for managing club operations, including player management, team scheduling, match records, staff accounts, and reporting tools.

## 🚀 Overview

Football Club ERP System is designed to help football clubs organize and manage their internal processes efficiently. The platform separates concerns by having:

- A **React frontend** responsible for user interface and experience.
- A **Django backend** that exposes REST API endpoints for data management and business logic.

The goal of this project is to build a scalable, maintainable, and performant system that can serve as a foundation for future club tools and modules.:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
